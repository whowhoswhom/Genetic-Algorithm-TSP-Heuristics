⚙️ How It Works
Initial Population - Random routes are generated.
Selection - The best routes are chosen based on fitness.
Crossover & Mutation - Routes are combined and altered to create new ones.
Evolution - The process repeats until an optimal solution is found.
Visualization - The GUI displays the evolution of the solution.
