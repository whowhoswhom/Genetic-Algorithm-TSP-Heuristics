# Genetic-Algorithm-TSP-Heuristics
This project uses a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Chinese Postman Problem by finding the shortest route that traverses all edges in a graph. It combines heuristic initialization using Minimum Spanning Trees, Wisdom of Crowds for refinement, and adaptive mutation rates to optimize solution quality.
